# C# Coding Challenge #7: Call me Knight

Have you ever wondered how hard it is to live as a chess knight in the modern world? How to dial a number and make a phone call? And is it possible to dial the required number?

![](https://github.com/AndreyM-DXC/CsKnightChallenge/blob/master/banner.png?raw=true)

**Task:** How many distinct numbers can you dial?

**Rules:**
* You can start from any position.
* You can move as a chess knight.
* You can make exactly **N** hops.
* You are the knight!

**Example:**
* **N** is zero: 0 numbers.
* **N** is one: 10 numbers.
* **N** is two: let's count, 1-6, 2-9, 9-2, 0-4, ... many!

**Goal:**

Implement a function to count distinct dialable numbers for given **N**.
```
1 2 3    The knight uses a classic dial pad with only numbers.
4 5 6    A phone number is a simple sequence of digits of length N.
7 8 9
  0
```

Feel free to use external libraries, but keep in mind that bot should be simple to assemble. ðŸ¤“
